### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup.
- CSS (custom) properties.
- Flexbox.
- Javascript


### Continued development

Code still needs to be structured properly -using DRY principle- creating functions for repeated code. 


### Useful resources

- [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8BZvfRD_eU&t=21s) - This helped me understand the proper markup of elements required to make a toggle button.
